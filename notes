given two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2), the distance between them is calculated as such:

racine de ((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1	)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)

V+ (x2 - x1)^2 = Viewport
Vx_min = min x value on Viewport
Vx_max = max x value on Viewport
Vw = "Viewport width" Vx-max -Vx_min
Vx_diff = 0 -Vx_min

Cw = Canvas width
Cx = Vx - Vx_diff * Cw/Vw

Vy_min = min y value on Viewport

C = canvas

Cx = Vx +
